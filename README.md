# Chutes-And-Ladders

This project looks to simulate and analyze naive artificial intelligence agents playing a game similar to Chutes and Ladders. This game includes a three dimensional playing space, multiple player tokens and personalities, as well as differing game board spaces to add difficulty to the game. This project was completed as a semester long development tool to learn data structures and algorithms as a part of CS 150 - Lafayette College.
